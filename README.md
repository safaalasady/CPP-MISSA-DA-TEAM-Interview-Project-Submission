## Data Analytics Team Application Project — Data Science Salaries

Overview:
This project focuses on developing foundational skills in the data analysis process — from asking questions to cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data. Using the Data Science Salaries 2023 dataset, I explored relationships between factors such as experience level, job title, and salary to uncover insights about trends in the data science job market.

Objectives:
- Formulate clear, data-driven questions and hypotheses.
- Clean and standardize the dataset to ensure consistency.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key patterns and correlations.
- Visualize findings using clear and effective charts or dashboards.
- Summarize insights and present recommendations based on the results.
